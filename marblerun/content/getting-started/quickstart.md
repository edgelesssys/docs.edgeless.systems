# Quickstart

In this guide, you will install Marblerun into your Kubernetes cluster and deploy a sample confidential application to demonstrate the capabilities of Marblerun.

Installing Marblerun is easy. First, you will install the CLI (command-line interface) onto your local machine. Using this CLI, you’ll then install the control plane onto your Kubernetes cluster.
Finally, you will add your own services and set up a corresponding manifest.


!> A working SGX DCAP environment is required for Marblerun to work. For the ease of exploring and testing we provide a simulation mode with `--simulation` that runs without SGX hardware.
In this quickstart, we deploy Marblerun in simulation mode. Be aware that this is not meant for production and runs without real SGX enclaves.

## Step 0: Setup

First, ensure you have access to a Kubernetes cluster and kubectl installed and configured. Probably the easiest way to get started is to run Kubernetes on your local machine using [Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/workflows/tools/install-minikube/). Another easy way is to use [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/kubernetes-walkthrough-portal), which offers SGX-enabled nodes.

You can validate your setup by running:

```bash
kubectl version --short
```

You should see an output with both a Client Version and Server Version component.
Now your cluster is ready and we’ll install the Marblerun CLI.

## Step 1: Install the CLI

If this is your first time running Marblerun, you will need to download the marblerun command-line interface (CLI) onto your local machine. The CLI will allow you to interact with your Marblerun deployment.

To install the CLI, run:

**For the current user**

```bash
wget -P ~/.local/bin https://github.com/edgelesssys/marblerun/releases/latest/download/marblerun
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/marblerun
```

**Global install (requires root)**

```bash
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/marblerun https://github.com/edgelesssys/marblerun/releases/latest/download/marblerun
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/marblerun
```

Once installed, verify the CLI is running correctly with:

```bash
marblerun
```

## Step 2: Install the control plane onto your cluster

Now that you have the CLI running locally and a cluster that is ready to go, it’s time to install the control plane.

Install Marblerun's *Coordinator* control plane by running:

```bash
marblerun install --simulation
```

The `marblerun install` command generates a Kubernetes manifest with all the necessary control plane resources.
The simulation flag tells Marblerun that real SGX hardware might not be present and the SGX-layer should be emulated.

Wait for the control plane to finish installing:

```bash
marblerun check
```

This command will wait until all components of Marblerun are ready to be used or return an error after a timeout period is reached.

## Step 3: Initialize and verify the Coordinator

After installing the Coordinator we need to verify its integrity.
For this, we utilize SGX remote attestation and obtain the Coordinator's root certificate.

Port forward the Coordinator's Client API

```bash
kubectl -n marblerun port-forward svc/coordinator-client-api 4433:4433 --address localhost >/dev/null &
export MARBLERUN=localhost:4433
```

Verify the quote and get the Coordinator's root certificate

```bash
marblerun certificate root $MARBLERUN -o marblerun.crt --insecure
```

The CLI will obtain the Coordinator's remote attestation quote and verify it against the configuration on our [release page](github.com/edgelesssys/marblerun/releases/latest/download/coordinator-era.json).
The SGX quote proves the integrity of the Coordinator pod.
Since we are not using SGX hardware in this case (`--simulation`), the quote verification is omitted by marblerun.
The CLI returns a certificate and stores it as `marblerun.crt` in your current directory.
The certificate is bound to the quote and can be used for future verification.
It can also be used as a root of trust for [authenticating your confidential applications](content/features/attestation.md#external-attestation-of-the-app).

## Step 4: Deploy the demo application

To get a feel for how Marblerun would work for one of your services, you can install a demo application.
The emojivoto application is a standalone Kubernetes application that uses a mix of gRPC and HTTP calls to allow the users to vote on their favorite emojis.
Created as a demo application for the popular [Linkerd](https://linkerd.io) service mesh, we've made a confidential variant that uses a confidential service mesh for all gRPC and HTTP connections.
Clone the [demo application's repository]( https://github.com/edgelesssys/emojivoto.git) from the GitHub by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edgelesssys/emojivoto.git && cd emojivoto
```

Marblerun guarantees that the topology of your distributed app adheres to a manifest specified in simple JSON.
Marblerun verifies the integrity of services, bootstraps them, and sets up encrypted connections between them.
The emojivoto demo already comes with a [manifest](https://github.com/edgelesssys/emojivoto/blob/main/tools/manifest.json), which you can deploy onto Marblerun by running:

```bash
marblerun manifest set tools/manifest.json $MARBLERUN --insecure
```

You can check that the state of Marblerun changed and is now ready to authenticate your services by running:

```bash
marblerun status $MARBLERUN
```

Create and annotate the emojivoto namespace for [auto-injection](content/features/auto-injection.md):

```bash
kubectl create namespace emojivoto
marblerun namespace add emojivoto --no-sgx-injection
```

Finally, install the demo application onto your cluster.
Please make sure you have [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) ("the package manager for Kubernetes") installed at least at Version v3.2.0.
Install emojivoto into the emojivoto namespace by running:

```bash
helm install -f ./kubernetes/nosgx_values.yaml emojivoto ./kubernetes --create-namespace -n emojivoto
```

## Step 5: Watch it run

You can now check the Marblerun log and see the services being authenticated by the Coordinator.

```bash
kubectl -n marblerun logs -f -l edgeless.systems/control-plane-component=coordinator
```

Port forward the front-end web service to access it on your local machine by running:

```bash
sudo kubectl -n emojivoto port-forward svc/web-svc 443:443 --address 0.0.0.0
```

Now visit [https://localhost](https://localhost).
You'll be presented with a certificate warning because your browser does not know Marblerun's root certificate as a root of trust.
You can safely ignore this error for now and proceed to the website.
Voila! Your emoji votes have never been safer!
